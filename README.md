# home_scripts
This is a repo of the scripts I keep in ~/bin. It's really just an easy way of backing up what I have on my personal machine, but feel free to click through or clone any if you want.

## Details
These files are mostly written in BASH, but at least one is written in Python. Except for the ones that affect hardware (e.g. keyboard backlight), they should all run on any UNIX computer.

Check the header comments to see what each script does in more detail.

Currently running Ubuntu 17.
